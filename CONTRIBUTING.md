# How to Contribute

Thanks for helping. Keep it simple.

## Before You Push

Install Git LFS once. We use it for CAD, STL, STEP, PCB, video, PDF.

```
brew install git-lfs       # macOS
sudo apt install git-lfs   # Linux
git lfs install
```

Then `git add` and `git commit` work normally. See `docs/git-lfs.md`.

## Upload CAD

- Put editable files in `cad/source/` (keep the original format: .f3d, .FCStd, .SLDPRT, etc.)
- Always export and upload a `.step` to `cad/step/` so anyone can open it
- Export `.stl` to `cad/stl/` for 3D printing
- One folder per part if it has many versions

File name format: `part-name_v1.step`, `part-name_v2.step`

Example part names for this chair: `seat-pan_v1`, `back-frame_v2`, `armrest-yoke_v3`, `lumbar-bladder-mount_v1`, `controller-housing_v1`.

## Upload Electronics

- Schematics: PDF + source file (KiCad preferred)
- PCB: include Gerber zip for fab
- Update `electronics/bom/parts.csv` if you change parts

## Write Assembly Guide

- Use `assembly/README.md`
- Numbered steps. One photo per step.
- Photos in `assembly/photos/`, name them `step-01.jpg`, `step-02.jpg`...

## Rules

- No big words. Write so a beginner can follow.
- Test before you push. If you can, print or build it yourself first.
- Commit message: short, clear. Example: `add v2 lumbar bracket STEP file`
- One topic per Pull Request.
